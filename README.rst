qgpkg
========

Introduction
------------

qgpkg implements a `GeoPackage <http://geopackage.org/>`_ extension to store
QGIS mapping information in a GeoPackage database file.

The specification is separated into `QGIS extensions <https://github.com/pka/qgpkg/blob/master/qgis_geopackage_extension.md>`_ and  `OWS context extensions <https://github.com/pka/qgpkg/blob/master/ows_geopackage_extension.md>`_.

This fork and branch implements the `OWS context extension`. Please refer to the `original forked repository <https://github.com/pka/qgpkg>`_, for more information about the components.


QGIS plugin
-----------

The QGIS plugin adds two buttons to the QGIS GUI. One for saving the current
project in a GeoPackage file (disabled) and one for loading a QGIS project from a
GeoPackage file. The project is read using `this GeoPackage extension <https://github.com/GeoCat/qgpkg/blob/ows-spec/ows_geopackage_extension.md>`_.

Support is given for loading multiple layers and styles from the geopackage.
The example bellow refers to the geopackage multiple_layers.gpkg, on folder `examples <./examples>`_.
